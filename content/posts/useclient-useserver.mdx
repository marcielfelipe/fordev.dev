Next.js has continuously evolved to provide an increasingly optimized experience for modern web applications. With the introduction of **React Server Components (RSC)**, the `use server` directive plays a crucial role in efficient application development. But why should you prioritize `use server` over `use client`? In this article, we'll explore the main advantages of this approach.

## ‚ö° 1. Better Performance and Load Time

When using `use server`, operations are executed on the **server**, preventing unnecessary code from being sent to the client. This results in:

- **Less JavaScript in the browser**, reducing page load time.
- **Faster rendering**, since data is processed on the server before reaching the user.

Unlike `use client`, where all logic is processed on the client side, `use server` allows for a more efficient and lightweight initial load.

## üîí 2. Increased Security

Running code on the server means **sensitive data** doesn't need to be exposed to the client. With `use server`, you can keep API calls, database interactions, and authorization logic **out of the user's reach**, minimizing risks such as:

- Exposure of tokens and credentials.
- Manipulation of requests directly in the browser.
- Vulnerabilities in frontend code.

## üìâ 3. Reduced Bundle Size

One of the major issues in frontend applications is **bundle size**. The larger the code sent to the client, the longer the loading time and the worse the user experience. With `use server`, we can keep logic on the backend, significantly reducing the JavaScript delivered to the client.

Additionally, Next.js performs **automatic tree-shaking**, removing unnecessary code to optimize loading.

## üõ† 4. Better Developer Experience

Working with `use server` allows for:

- **More organized code**, separating frontend and backend responsibilities.
- **Better scalability**, as backend logic can be distributed and optimized without directly impacting the client.
- **Easier database integration**, since we can directly call ORMs (Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle) without exposing REST or GraphQL APIs in the frontend.

## üîç 5. SEO Efficiency and SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

Using `use server` allows pages to be pre-rendered on the server, bringing benefits such as:

- **Better SEO**, as search engines index fully rendered content.
- **Efficient SSR**, where data arrives ready to the user, avoiding additional JavaScript loads.

This is especially useful for blogs, e-commerce platforms, and any application that relies on good Google ranking.

## üìå When Should You Use `use client`?

Despite the advantages of `use server`, there are cases where `use client` is still necessary, such as:

- **UI interactivity**, like local states, click events, animations, and dynamic forms.
- **Components that require React hooks**, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.
- **Interactive components that do not depend on server-side data**, such as sliders and dropdown menus.

The main idea is to balance the use of `use server` for heavy processing and security, while `use client` should only be used where frontend interactivity is essential.

## üöÄ Conclusion

`use server` brings a more efficient and secure approach to Next.js applications, reducing bundle size, improving performance, and facilitating code organization. Choosing between `use server` and `use client` should be based on the application context, but prioritizing server-side processing whenever possible is a best practice.

If you're building modern applications with Next.js, take advantage of `use server` to create faster and more scalable experiences! üöÄ
