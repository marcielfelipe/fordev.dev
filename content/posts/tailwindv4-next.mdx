## 1. Create a New Next.js Project

Start by creating a new Next.js project. Itâ€™s recommended to use Create Next App for an easier setup:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-project --typescript --eslint --app
```

## 2. Install Tailwind CSS and Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

```bash
cd my-project
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

## 3. Configure Tailwind CSS

In Tailwind CSS v4, the configuration is done directly in the global CSS file. Edit the ./src/app/globals.css file and add the following line:

```bash
@import "tailwindcss";
```
This imports Tailwind CSS using the CSS-first approach.

## 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
Now, you can use Tailwind CSS utility classes in your Next.js components. For example, edit the ./src/app/page.tsx file to include a styled heading:

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello, Next.js with Tailwind CSS v4!</h1>;
}
```
With these steps, Tailwind CSS v4 will be configured in your Next.js project, ready for building modern and responsive interfaces.
